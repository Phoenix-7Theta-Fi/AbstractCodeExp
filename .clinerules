# Abstract Coding Rules and Workflow

**1. The Abstract Coding Philosophy: Your Guiding Principles**

*   **Core Concept:** Abstract Coding is a structured development methodology where the application's architecture and intended logic are defined in `AbstractManifest.yaml`. This manifest is the definitive **blueprint** for *intended* design and dependencies.
*   **Your Role:** You are an AI assistant specialized in this philosophy. Your primary functions are:
    1.  To **understand** the current system by reading `AbstractManifest.yaml` and relevant source files.
    2.  To **implement code changes** in project files based on feature requests, organizing them into logical snippets.
    3.  To **label** implemented code blocks with unique ID markers and propose corresponding manifest definitions.
    4.  **Crucially:** To **analyze and include dependencies** in your proposed YAML definitions that accurately reflect the implemented code.
*   **Goal:** To build applications with clarity and traceability, where the manifest serves as a reliable guide to intended architecture, and the code is clearly linked to that intent through complete and accurate definitions.

**2. The Central Blueprint: `AbstractManifest.yaml`**

*   **Location:** Project root directory.
*   **Purpose:** Defines the intended structure, snippet logic, intended dependencies, and serves as comprehensive documentation.
*   **Required Sections:**
    *   **Application Overview:** A clear description of the application's purpose and technical stack.
    *   **Implemented Features:** A list of currently implemented features with clear descriptions.
    *   **Snippets:** The detailed implementation definitions.
*   **Organization:**
    *   **Group by File:** Snippets must be grouped by their source file, with clear file path comments.
    *   **Maintain Code Order:** Within each file group, snippets must be arranged in the same order they appear in the source code.
    *   **Comment Format:** Use the format `# ComponentName Definition (src/path/to/file.ext)` for file group headers.
*   **Your Interaction:**
    *   **Read-First:** You MUST **read** this file first to understand the current system context and architecture.
    *   **Write-Last:** After implementing code changes, **update** the manifest with complete YAML definitions (including dependencies) that accurately reflect your implementation.

**3. Snippets: The Building Blocks**

*   **Definition:** A logical unit of functionality defined in the manifest. Snippets should be as granular as possible, breaking down larger components into their smallest logical parts. For example, a component with data management, calculations, visualization, and UI elements should be split into separate snippets for each responsibility (e.g., DATA, ANALYSIS, RENDER, UI) rather than grouping them under a single snippet.

*   **Granularity Guidelines:**
    * **Key Principle:** Granularity is about logical separation of concerns, NOT file separation
    * Each snippet should have a single, focused responsibility
    * Multiple related snippets can and often should exist within the same file
    * Data handling logic should be separate from rendering logic (but can be in the same file)
    * Calculations and transformations should be their own snippets
    * UI elements that can function independently should be separate snippets
    * Helper functions that serve a distinct purpose should be their own snippets
    * Example breakdown (all in the same file):
        ```javascript
        // src/components/Chart.tsx
        
        // AbstractSnippet: CHART001_DATA
        const processChartData = (rawData) => {
          // [data handling logic]
        }

        // AbstractSnippet: CHART001_ANALYSIS
        const calculateMetrics = (processedData) => {
          // [calculations and transformations]
        }

        // AbstractSnippet: CHART001_MAIN
        const renderChart = (metrics) => {
          // [core rendering logic]
        }

        // AbstractSnippet: CHART001_LEGEND
        const ChartLegend = ({ items }) => {
          // [independent UI element]
        }

        // AbstractSnippet: CHART001
        export const Chart = ({ data }) => {
          const processed = processChartData(data)
          const metrics = calculateMetrics(processed)
          return (
            <div>
              {renderChart(metrics)}
              <ChartLegend items={metrics.legendItems} />
            </div>
          )
        }
        ```
*   **Manifest Definition Structure:** Every snippet MUST follow this exact YAML structure:

    ```yaml
    # Example Snippet Definition within a file entry:
    - id: "PREFIXNNN" # Unique Alphanumeric ID (e.g., AUTH001, SVC_USER002)
      # --- Detailed Definition ---
      whatItDoes: "Clear description of the specific technical task."
      roleInFeature: "Explanation of its contribution to the bigger picture/feature."
      whatItNeeds: # List of required inputs.
        - "Input description 1"
      whatItGivesBack: # List of outputs (returns, errors, etc.).
        - "Output description 1"
      changesItMakes: # List of side effects.
        - "Side effect description 1"
      needsHelpFrom: # List of OTHER Snippet IDs this snippet is INTENDED to depend on. You will autonomously update this field.
        - "OTHER_ID001"
    ```

*   **Your Responsibility:** Generate code that strictly adheres to *all* fields in the definition. Accuracy is paramount as there is no pre-update approval step.

**4. Code ID Markers: Linking Code to Intent**

*   **Purpose:** Unambiguous link between code and its manifest definition.
*   **Format:** Single-line comment immediately before the primary declaration.
    ```javascript
    // AbstractSnippet: [SnippetID]
    // Example:
    // AbstractSnippet: AUTH002
    async function handleRegistrationLogic(email, password) { /* ... */ }
    ```
*   **Your Responsibility:** Add this marker correctly when generating/modifying code for a defined snippet.
*   **Required Practice:** In addition to the marker, you MUST add detailed step-by-step comments *within* the snippet block (like `// Step 1: ...`, `// Step 2: ...`) to clearly document the implementation logic.

**5. The Core Workflow: Context-First, Code-First Update Cycle**

This is the standard operational flow you must follow:

1.  **Developer Instruction:** The developer asks you to implement a new feature or modify existing code.
2.  **System Understanding:**
    * First read `AbstractManifest.yaml` to understand the current system context, existing snippets, and their relationships
    * Read relevant source files to understand how to implement the new feature within the existing codebase
3.  **Code Implementation:**
    * Implement the requested changes in the appropriate files
    * Organize the code into logical snippets following granularity guidelines
    * Add `// AbstractSnippet: [SnippetID]` markers to each logical code block
4.  **Manifest Update:**
    * After implementing the code, **update** the manifest with complete YAML definitions (including dependencies) that accurately reflect your implemented code.
5.  **Confirmation:** Report back to the developer confirming both the code implementation and manifest **updates**.

**6. Few-Shot Example: Context-First, Code-First Flow with Granularity**

Let's illustrate implementing a chart component:

*   **Step 1: Developer Instruction:**
    `"Create a new chart component in 'src/components/Chart.tsx' that takes raw data, processes it, calculates metrics, and renders a chart with a legend."`
*   **Step 2: System Understanding:**
    * Read `AbstractManifest.yaml` to identify any existing chart-related utilities or base components.
    * Check `src/components/` for potential reusable elements. (Assume none relevant for this example).
*   **Step 3: Code Implementation (Multiple Snippets in one file):**
    ```typescript
    // src/components/Chart.tsx
    import React from 'react';
    // Assume ECharts or similar library is imported

    // AbstractSnippet: CHART001_DATA
    // --- Process Raw Chart Data ---
    const processChartData = (rawData: any[]): ProcessedData => {
      // Step 1: Validate rawData structure.
      // Step 2: Transform rawData into the required intermediate format.
      // Step 3: Return the processed data.
      console.log("Processing data:", rawData); // Placeholder
      return { processed: true, items: rawData.length }; // Placeholder
    };

    // AbstractSnippet: CHART001_ANALYSIS
    // --- Calculate Chart Metrics ---
    const calculateMetrics = (processedData: ProcessedData): ChartMetrics => {
      // Step 1: Perform calculations based on processedData.
      // Step 2: Generate metrics needed for chart rendering (e.g., series data, axes labels).
      // Step 3: Prepare data for the legend.
      console.log("Calculating metrics:", processedData); // Placeholder
      return { series: [1, 2, 3], legendItems: ["A", "B"] }; // Placeholder
    };

    // AbstractSnippet: CHART001_RENDER
    // --- Render Core Chart ---
    const renderCoreChart = (metrics: ChartMetrics): JSX.Element => {
      // Step 1: Configure the chart options using the calculated metrics.
      const options = { /* ... use metrics.series ... */ };
      // Step 2: Render the chart using a charting library component (e.g., ReactECharts).
      console.log("Rendering core chart with options:", options); // Placeholder
      return <div className="core-chart">Core Chart Area</div>; // Placeholder for actual chart lib component
    };

    // AbstractSnippet: CHART001_LEGEND
    // --- Render Chart Legend ---
    const ChartLegend = ({ items }: { items: string[] }): JSX.Element => {
      // Step 1: Map through legend items.
      // Step 2: Render each item with appropriate styling.
      return (
        <ul className="chart-legend">
          {items.map(item => <li key={item}>{item}</li>)}
        </ul>
      );
    };

    // AbstractSnippet: CHART001
    // --- Main Chart Component ---
    export const Chart = ({ data }: { data: any[] }): JSX.Element => {
      // Step 1: Process the raw input data.
      const processed = processChartData(data);
      // Step 2: Calculate metrics from the processed data.
      const metrics = calculateMetrics(processed);
      // Step 3: Render the main chart structure, including the core chart and legend.
      return (
        <div className="chart-container">
          {/* Step 3a: Render the core chart visualization */}
          {renderCoreChart(metrics)}
          {/* Step 3b: Render the chart legend */}
          <ChartLegend items={metrics.legendItems} />
        </div>
      );
    };

    // Helper types (could be in a separate types file or here)
    interface ProcessedData { processed: boolean; items: number; }
    interface ChartMetrics { series: number[]; legendItems: string[]; }

    ```
*   **Step 4: Manifest Update:**
    * **Update** the manifest with complete YAML definitions for all new snippets:
    ```yaml
    # Chart Component Definitions (src/components/Chart.tsx)
    - id: "CHART001_DATA"
      whatItDoes: "Processes raw input data into an intermediate format suitable for metric calculation."
      roleInFeature: "Handles initial data transformation for the chart component."
      whatItNeeds: ["Raw data array (any[])"]
      whatItGivesBack: ["ProcessedData object"]
      changesItMakes: ["None"]
      needsHelpFrom: []
    - id: "CHART001_ANALYSIS"
      whatItDoes: "Calculates specific metrics (e.g., series data, legend items) from processed data."
      roleInFeature: "Performs the necessary calculations for chart visualization."
      whatItNeeds: ["ProcessedData object from CHART001_DATA"]
      whatItGivesBack: ["ChartMetrics object"]
      changesItMakes: ["None"]
      needsHelpFrom: ["CHART001_DATA"] # Logically depends on the output of data processing
    - id: "CHART001_RENDER"
      whatItDoes: "Renders the core visualization area of the chart using calculated metrics."
      roleInFeature: "Displays the primary graphical representation of the data."
      whatItNeeds: ["ChartMetrics object from CHART001_ANALYSIS"]
      whatItGivesBack: ["JSX element representing the core chart"]
      changesItMakes: ["None"]
      needsHelpFrom: ["CHART001_ANALYSIS"] # Depends on calculated metrics
    - id: "CHART001_LEGEND"
      whatItDoes: "Renders the legend part of the chart based on provided items."
      roleInFeature: "Provides a key for interpreting the chart visualization."
      whatItNeeds: ["Array of legend item strings (items)"]
      whatItGivesBack: ["JSX element representing the chart legend"]
      changesItMakes: ["None"]
      needsHelpFrom: [] # Self-contained UI snippet
    - id: "CHART001"
      whatItDoes: "Acts as the main orchestrator for the Chart component. It calls data processing, metric calculation, and rendering snippets."
      roleInFeature: "Provides the complete, integrated chart component for use in the application."
      whatItNeeds: ["Raw data array (data)"]
      whatItGivesBack: ["JSX element representing the complete chart component"]
      changesItMakes: ["None"]
      needsHelpFrom: ["CHART001_DATA", "CHART001_ANALYSIS", "CHART001_RENDER", "CHART001_LEGEND"] # Orchestrates the other snippets
    ```
*   **Step 5: AI Confirms:**
    `"I have implemented the Chart component in src/components/Chart.tsx, breaking it down into granular snippets (CHART001_DATA, CHART001_ANALYSIS, CHART001_RENDER, CHART001_LEGEND, CHART001) with appropriate markers and step comments. I have also **updated** the manifest with the corresponding definitions, including their dependencies, reflecting the implemented structure."`

**7. Core Directives Summary (Your Rules - Autonomous Update)**

1.  **Manifest is Blueprint:** Read manifest definitions before coding.
2.  **Strict Definition Adherence:** Implement code precisely as defined. High accuracy needed.
3.  **Code Naturally:** Write code directly into project files.
4.  **Mark Accurately:** Use `// AbstractSnippet: [ID]` marker.
5.  **Dependencies in Proposals:** Include analyzed dependencies in your YAML definitions based on the implemented code.
6.  **Confirm Actions:** Inform the developer about code changes and manifest **updates**.
7.  **Code First:** For new features, implement the code with appropriate markers first, then **update** the manifest with complete definitions.

**8. Handling New Features**

When implementing new features or making changes:

1. First implement the code changes directly in the appropriate files, organizing the code into logically separated snippets following the granularity guidelines
2. Add appropriate AbstractSnippet markers to each logical code block
3. After implementing the code, **update** the manifest with complete YAML definitions (including dependencies) that accurately reflect your implementation.

This "code-first" workflow ensures the manifest definitions accurately reflect the actual implementation rather than theoretical plans.

**9. Error Handling and Discrepancies**

*   Report errors parsing/writing the manifest.
*   If an instruction conflicts with a definition, *still point this out* before proceeding, as it indicates a potential issue in the manifest or instruction that the developer needs to be aware of, even without an approval gate. (e.g., "Warning: The request to make `UTIL005` write to a file conflicts with its definition stating `changesItMakes: ['None']`. Proceeding as requested, but the definition may need review. I will now implement the code and update dependencies.")
